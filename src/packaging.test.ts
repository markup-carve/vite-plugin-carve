/**
 * What an `exports` map does is decided by Node's resolver, against an
 * INSTALLED package. Reading this repository's own manifest with `readFileSync`
 * and asserting a key is present answers a different question - "what does the
 * file say" - and such an assertion passes just as happily with the entry
 * deleted. carve-js had exactly that test and it did (carve-js#1260).
 *
 * So this file asks the resolver instead. A scratch directory gets the
 * `node_modules` layout an install produces, this package is linked into it,
 * and a real `node` reads the specifier back from that directory the way a
 * consumer's CI step would.
 *
 * The link points at the repository root, so `tsconfig.json` and `src/` are
 * present on disk under the installed name. That is what makes the
 * encapsulation assertion below mean something: those paths are reachable and
 * still have to be refused.
